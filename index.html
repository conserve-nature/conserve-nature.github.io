                <p class="small bio">
                  Michael’s career has been predominantly associated with undertaking applied research to improve the management of invasive mammals that impact on native wildlife populations. His early career included support to a number projects within the Victorian Government’s Vertebrate Pest Research Unit. Primarily, he was involved in the development of the Curiosity® bait for feral cat control between 1996-2006 and led the research for the subsequent period to 2014. He continues to undertake research to inform conservation land managers on the use of the product. He has assisted in the development of spin-off products such as the Hisstory® bait as well as lethal implants. Michael has contributed to the successful eradication of feral cat populations on Tasman and Dirk Hartog Islands and a feral pig eradication on Quail Island. He designed and led on-ground operations for the attempted feral cat eradication program on French Island until the point that the project became untenable. He is contributing to similar operations on islands in Bass Strait, the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Monitoring and reporting the legacy outcomes of eradication programs continues is a source of pride. Michael has a keen interest in adapting new technologies to support biodiversity conservation outcomes and regards iPAW as a necessary vehicle to support the development and adoption of new management and monitoring tools. Michael established Ecolegacy Pty Ltd in 2023 and has an established professional network with fruitful collaborations throughout Australia, New Zealand and beyond. His research has been published in a range of peer-reviewed and popular press journals.
